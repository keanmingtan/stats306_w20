And that’s despite, I’d argue, the two best position players in the NL this year (Christian Yelich and Lorenzo Cain) being Brewers outfielders. More importantly, the distance from Boston and Milwaukee to the third-place Yankees is about five wins. Two-thirds of the Los Angeles Angels’ outfield is Mike Trout (the best player in baseball) and Justin Upton (a four-time All-Star who hit 30 home runs and posted a 122 OPS+ and .348 wOba this year), and in order to get to 11.5 WAA, the Angels’ outfield would have had to replace right fielder Kole Calhoun with one of the three best outfielders in baseball this year by WAA.`"
